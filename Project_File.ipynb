Their current project involves the creation an embodied AI model, which is an AI able to recieve, understand, and respond to a complex environment, similar to how humans interact with the world around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the popular game: \"Minecraft\" was chosen as the \"complex environment\". Behavioural data, such as locations visited, what players said in chat, in game actions, etc. were taken from players of the \"PLAICRAFT\" server, a free Minecraft server ran by PLAI, in order to study the trends and patterns of how players interact with the virtual world. This data will then be used to train and develop the AI model.\n",

Secondly, the datatype of the `start_time` and `end_time` variables is character (chr) which will be needed to be converted to double (dbl) or integer (int) in order to perform calculations (e.g average play time in hours on x day). Lastly, the `original_start_time` and `original_end_time` are in a very starnge format which is hard to understand, conversion into a more drect format would benefit clarity of the data."
